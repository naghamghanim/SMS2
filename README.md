# Google sholars and ACM digital library crawler by beautiful suop
Google_sholars and ACM digital library crawler for collecting papers title, authors name, abstract and years

# Instruction:
1. clone the repository
2. Run code :D

# warning
Both google scholars and ACM digital Library will block IP after sending so many requests. In my experience, I got blocked from ACM after a 4-5k request. Therefore, I had to run a yearly code basis with a small range of pagination. I did my job done. was able to scrape 20k+ data.

But for google scholar, I got block after 1000 requests. I put a sleep code to control each loop run time. However, this problem will continue. I would suggest using multiple computers or different IPs after some intervals.

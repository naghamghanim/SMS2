# Google sholars and ACM digital library crawler by beautiful suop
Google_sholars and ACM digital library crawler for collecting papers title, authors name, abstract and years

# Instruction:
1. clone the repository
2. Run code :D

# warning
Both google scholars and ACM digital Library will block ip after sending so many request. In my experience. I got blok from ACM after 4-5k request. Therefore i had to run code yearly basis with small range of pagination. I did my job done. was able to scrape 20k+ data.

but for gooogle scholars I got block after 1000 request. I put a sleep code to controll each loop run time. However, this propblem will continue. I would suggest to use multiple computer or different IP after some intervals.
